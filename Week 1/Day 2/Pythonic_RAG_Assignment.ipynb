This can slow things down and leave your system doing nothing but waiting during that time.\n",

            "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on the specific task you want to accomplish, but there are a few general principles you can follow to make your loops clean and efficient. Here are some common types of loops and tips for writing them effectively:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **For Loop**: Use a `for` loop when you know the number of iterations or when you're iterating over a collection (like a list, tuple, or dictionary).\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of a for loop iterating over a list\n",
            "   fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "   for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "       print(fruit)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **While Loop**: Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance and you want to loop until a certain condition is met.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of a while loop\n",
            "   count = 0\n",
            "   while count < 5:\n",
            "       print(count)\n",
            "       count += 1  # Don't forget to update the condition to avoid infinite loops!\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Using Enumerate**: When iterating over a list and need both the index and the value, use `enumerate()` for cleaner code.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example using enumerate\n",
            "   for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
            "       print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **List Comprehensions**: For simple loops that create a new list, consider using a list comprehension for a more Pythonic approach.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of a list comprehension\n",
            "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "   print(squares)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Avoiding Nested Loops**: If you find yourself using nested loops, see if there's a way to simplify your logic or use built-in functions that might eliminate the need for them.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Readability and Comments**: Keep your loops readable. Use descriptive variable names and comment your code if necessary to explain complex logic.\n",

We also provide data loading helpers to\\nconstruct training data that is compatible with HuggingFace trainers:\\ntokenizer = transformers . AutoTokenizer . from_pretrained ( model_name_or_path )\\n# get training data with customised dataloaders\\ndata_module = make_supervised_data_module (\\ntokenizer = tokenizer , model =model , layers =[19] ,\\ntraining_args = training_args , data_args = data_args )\\n# train\\ntrainer = reft .

Given that previous works have unified PEFTs\\nunder a single framework [He et al., 2022a], one may ask why not express ReFT as a PEFT\\nmethod? The main reason is that PEFT frameworks lack the notion of time orsequence (see the\\nunified PEFT view provided in Table 1 on pg. 5 of He et al., 2022a). In PEFTs, representation\\nmodifications are necessarily applied to every token in the sequence, even in recent variants such as\\nAdaLoRA [Zhang et al., 2023]. A key aspect of ReFT is that it leverages representations over time\\nand intervenes only on a small number of them while being effective. More importantly, the notation\\nof time is important for future versions of ReFT that intervene on representations schematically\\n(e.g. intervene on the first token at some early layers and then intervene on the last token at some later\\nlayers). The ability to intervene at different layer and position combinations schematically is also\\nsupported in our code. Existing PEFT libraries7enforce weight-based updates without supporting\\nflexible representation-based interventions.\\nB.1 RED\\nRED [Wu et al., 2024a] is a simple representation-editing method that applies an element-wise scaling\\ntransform s∈Rnand adds a bias b∈Rnto the hidden representation in every layer. The same\\nintervention is applied to every position (including at generated tokens, increasing inference burden)\\n7Seehttps://github.com/huggingface/peft .\\n20',\n",

We first define a general notion of intervention , i.e. the\\nmodification of hidden representations during the model forward pass:\\nDefinition 3.1. Anintervention Iis a tuple ⟨Φ, P, l⟩that encapsulates a single inference-time\\nmodification of the representations computed by a Transformer-based LM. The three components of\\nan intervention are (1) the intervention function Φ∶Rd→Rdwith learned parameters ϕ, (2) a set\\nofinput positions P⊆{1, . . . , n}that the intervention is applied to, and (3) the layer l∈{1, . . . , m}\\nat which the intervention is applied.\\nWe implement the intervention Ias the following operation that overwrites some representations h:\\nh(l)←(Φ(h(l)\\np)ifp∈Pelseh(l)\\np)p∈1,...,n(7)\\nThe intervention is applied immediately after the computation of h(l)and thus affects the representa-\\ntions computed in later layers h(l+1), . . . ,h(m).\\nFigure 2 provides a schematic overview of an intervention. A ReFT is then defined as a constrained\\nset of non-overlapping interventions:\\nDefinition 3.2. AReFT method is a set of finterventions I={I1, . . . , I f}. We enforce that for\\nany two interventions Ij, Ik∈Isuch that they operate on the same layer lj=lk, their intervention\\npositions must be disjoint, i.e. Pj∩Pk=∅. The parameters (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ f)of all of the intervention\\nfunctions are independent.\\nReFT is thus a generic framework encompassing interventions on hidden representations during the\\nmodel forward pass. In appendix B, we show how a variety of existing inference-time intervention\\nmethods can be described within this framework.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate our ReFTs against existing PEFTs, we conduct experiments across four diverse NLP\\nbenchmarks covering more than 20 datasets (extensive details on our datasets are in appendix C).\\nOur goal is to provide a rich picture of how LoReFT and DiReFT perform in different scenarios. We\\nexperiment with both masked and autoregressive LMs at different scales, ranging from RoBERTa-\\nbase [Liu et al., 2019] with 125M to LLaMA models [Touvron et al., 2023a,b] with 13B parameters.\\nWe benchmark against existing PEFTs such as prefix-tuning [Li and Liang, 2021], adapter-tuning\\nwith both Series Adapters and Parallel Adapters, BitFit [Ben Zaken et al., 2022], RED [Wu et al.,\\n2024a], LoRA [Hu et al., 2022], and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. Our comparisons focus on both\\nperformance and parameter efficiency. In our comparisons, we use hyperparameter-tuned scores from\\nprevious works when possible. We load our base LMs in torch.bfloat16 to save memory. All of\\nour experiments are run with a single GPU: NVIDIA A100 40G/80G or RTX 6000 .
