This can slow things down and leave your system doing nothing but waiting during that time.\n",

With finetuning, a single base model can be adapted to a variety of tasks given\\nonly small amounts of in-domain data. However, finetuning large LMs is expensive. Parameter-\\nefficient finetuning (PEFT) methods propose to address the high costs of full finetuning by updating a\\nsmall number of weights. This reduces memory usage and training time, and PEFTs achieve similar\\nperformance to full finetuning in many settings [Hu et al., 2023].\\nA hallmark of current state-of-the-art PEFTs is that they modify weights rather than representations .\\nHowever, much prior interpretability work has shown that representations encode rich semantic\\ninformation, suggesting that editing representations might be a more powerful alternative to weight\\nupdates. In this paper, we pursue this hypothesis by developing and motivating Representation\\nFinetuning (ReFT) . Instead of adapting model weights, ReFT methods train interventions that\\nmanipulate a small fraction of model representations in order to steer model behaviors to solve\\ndownstream tasks at inference time. ReFT methods are drop-in replacements for weight-based PEFTs.\\nThis approach is inspired by recent work in LM interpretability that intervenes on representations to\\nfind faithful causal mechanisms [Geiger et al., 2023b] and to steer model behaviours at inference time\\n[Turner et al., 2023, Li et al., 2024], and it can be seen as a generalisation of the representation-editing\\nwork of Wu et al. [2024a], Turner et al. [2023], and Zou et al. [2023] (see appendix B for details).\\n*Equal contribution.\\nPreprint.

Despite training far fewer\\nparameters than existing PEFTs, LoReFT achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art performance\\non all tasks. Its value is most apparent for the largest models in our evaluations. Note : FT is\\nfull-parameter finetuning, which is not a PEFT or ReFT method. Additional results are in section 4.\\nWe focus on a strong and highly efficient instance of the ReFT family that we call Low-rank\\nLinear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT ). LoReFT is a parametrisation of ReFT that intervenes on hidden\\nrepresentations in the linear subspace spanned by a low-rank projection matrix, building directly\\non the distributed alignment search (DAS) method of Geiger et al. [2023b] and Wu et al. [2023].\\nWe also identify an ablation of this method (DiReFT) that trades some performance for increased\\nefficiency. We evaluate our ReFTs on LLaMA-family models and small-scale LMs against existing\\nPEFTs on standard benchmarks from four domains: commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning,\\ninstruction-following, and natural language understanding. Compared to LoRA, we find that LoReFT\\nuses 15×–65×times fewer parameters while achieving state-of-the-art performance on commonsense\\nreasoning, instruction-following, and natural language understanding against the strongest PEFTs.\\nThese findings indicate that ReFT methods are worthy of further exploration, as they may emerge as\\nmore efficient and effective alternatives to weight-based PEFTs.\\n2 Related work\\nParameter-efficient finetuning methods (PEFTs). PEFTs train a fraction of the model’s parameters\\nto adapt it to downstream tasks. We classify PEFTs into three categories:\\n1.Adapter-based methods train additional modules (e.g. fully-connected layers) on top of the\\nfrozen pretrained model. Series adapters insert components between LM attention or MLP\\nlayers [Houlsby et al., 2019, Pfeiffer et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2022, He et al., 2022b, Fu et al.,\\n2021], while parallel adapters add modules alongside existing components [He et al., 2022a].\\nSince adapters add new components that cannot be easily folded into existing model weights,\\nthey impose an additional burden at inference time.1\\n2.LoRA [Hu et al., 2022] and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c] use low-rank matrices to approximate\\nadditive weight updates during training, and require no additional overhead during inference\\nsince the weight updates can be merged into the model. These are the strongest PEFTs currently.2\\n3.Prompt-based methods add randomly-initialised soft tokens to the input (usually as a prefix)\\nand train their embeddings while keeping the LM weights frozen [Li and Liang, 2021]. These\\n1Several very recent papers introduce new adapter architectures but do not benchmark them on the tasks\\nwe consider, or they perform hyperparameter-tuning in a different setup than done in this work. These include:\\nLLaMA-Adapter [Zhang et al., 2024b], LLaMA-Adapter v2 [Gao et al., 2023], Aligner [Ziheng et al., 2023].\\n2Additional methods not studied in this work: AutoLoRA [Zhang et al., 2024c], ResLoRA [Shi et al., 2024],\\nSiRA [Zhu et al., 2023].\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='methods are often far from optimal compared to other PEFTs, and come at the cost of significant\\ninference overhead. A variant of this method where hidden-layer activations are also tuned was\\nintroduced as a baseline in Hu et al. [2022], with better performance.\\nRepresentation editing. Recent work on activation steering andrepresentation engineering shows\\nthat adding fixed or task-specific steering vectors [Subramani et al., 2022, Turner et al., 2023, Zou\\net al., 2023, Liu et al., 2024b, V ogel, 2024, Li et al., 2024] or applying concept erasure [Ravfogel\\net al., 2022, Belrose et al., 2023, Avitan et al., 2024, Singh et al., 2024] to the residual stream can\\nenable a degree of control over pretrained LM generations without the need for resource-intensive\\nfinetuning [Wu et al., 2024a]. The success of these methods affirms that representations induced by\\npretrained LMs carry rich semantic structure.\\nInterventional interpretability. Much recent work has used interventions on model-internal states\\nto test hypotheses about how LMs implement various behaviours. In particular, interventions on linear\\nsubspaces of representations have provided increasing evidence that human-interpretable concepts are\\nencoded linearly [Smolensky, 1986, Rumelhart et al., 1986, McClelland et al., 1986]. This includes\\nlinguistic features such as gender and number [Lasri et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Hanna et al.,\\n2023, Chintam et al., 2023, Yamakoshi et al., 2023, Hao and Linzen, 2023, Chen et al., 2023, Amini\\net al., 2023, Guerner et al., 2023, Arora et al., 2024], logical and mathematical reasoning [Wu et al.,\\n2023], entity attributes [Huang et al., 2024], and a number of other domains [Mikolov et al., 2013,\\nElhage et al., 2022, Park et al., 2023, Nanda et al., 2023, Guerner et al., 2023].\\n3 ReFT\\nWe now define the ReFT family of methods. To do this, we first summarize the core motivation,\\nwhich emerges from work on intervention-based model interpretability. We then show how this leads\\ndirectly to Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT). Finally, we generalize this to a family of\\nReFT methods. Appendix A provides a brief overview of our generic ReFT training library.\\nTo keep the presentation simple, we assume throughout that our target model is a Transformer-\\nbased [Vaswani et al., 2017] LM that produces contextualised representations of sequences of tokens.\\nGiven a sequence of ninput tokens x=(x1, . . . , x n), the model first embeds these into a list of\\nrepresentations h(0)=(h(0)\\n1, . . . ,h(0)\\nn). Then, mlayers successively compute the j-th list of hidden\\nrepresentations h(j)as a function of the previous list of hidden representations h(j−1). Each hidden\\nrepresentation is a vector h∈Rd. The LM uses the final hidden representations h(m)to produce its\\npredictions. In our experiments, we consider both autoregressive LMs and masked LMs [Devlin et al.,\\n2019]. An autoregressive LM predicts p(xn+1∣x1, . . . , x n)=softmax (Wh(m)\\nn), while a masked\\nLM predicts p(xi∣x1, . . . , x i−1, xi+1, . . . , x n)=softmax (Wh(m)\\ni), where Wis a learned matrix\\nmapping from representations to logits over the vocabulary space.\\n3.1 Motivation\\nIn interpretability research, the framework of causal abstraction [Geiger et al., 2021] uses interchange\\ninterventions to establish the causal role of representations in deep learning models. An interchange\\nintervention fixes a representation to the value it would take if a counterfactual input were processed\\nby the model. Experiments investigating how such interventions affect model behavior form the\\nevidence for claims about the causal role of a representation and the concept it encodes.\\nTo test whether a concept is encoded in a linear subspace of a representation, one may use a dis-\\ntributed interchange intervention (DII) [Geiger et al., 2023b].3Letbbe the hidden representation\\ncreated at row iand column kwhen our model processes input b, and let sbe the corresponding'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='tributed interchange intervention (DII) [Geiger et al., 2023b].3Letbbe the hidden representation\\ncreated at row iand column kwhen our model processes input b, and let sbe the corresponding\\nrepresentation when that same model processes input s.

DAS is\\nhighly expressive, and can effectively localize concepts within model representations [Wu et al., 2023,\\nArora et al., 2024, Wu et al., 2024c, Huang et al., 2024]. This suggests that subspace representation\\ninterventions could also be a powerful tool for model control.\\n3.2 Two low-rank ReFT instantiations\\nLoReFT. The formulation of DIIin eq. (1) immediately suggests a way to control model generations\\nvia interventions. The guiding intuition is that we can learn how to perform interventions that steer\\nthe model towards predicting our task labels. The resulting method, Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT\\n(LoReFT), is defined by the following variant of eq. (1):\\nΦLoReFT(h)=h+R⊺(Wh+b−Rh) (2)\\nThis is identical to eq. (1), except we use a learned projected source Rs=Wh+b. LoReFT thus\\nedits the representation in the r-dimensional subspace spanned by the rows of Rto take on the\\nvalues obtained from our linear projection Wh+b. We depict this operation in fig. 2. The learned\\nparameters are ϕ={R,W,b}; the parameters of the LM are frozen. As with DII,R∈Rr×dis a\\nlow-rank matrix with orthonormal rows where dis the hidden-state dimensionality and r≤dis the\\nrank of the subspace. We further define a linear projection W∈Rr×dand bias vector b∈Rr.\\nDiReFT. In addition, we define an ablation of LoReFT which removes the orthogonality constraint\\nand the difference operation, reducing training time:\\nΦDiReFT(h)=h+W⊺\\n2(W1h+b) (3)\\nBothW1,W2∈Rr×dare low-rank projection matrices. Note that eq. (3) resembles LoRA, and thus\\nDiReFT can be thought of as LoRA applied directly to hidden representations at certain positions.4\\nEmpirical evidence from previous work suggests that adding orthogonal constraints to LoRA weights\\nincreases performance [Liu et al., 2024d]. (Appendix E reports results for additional ablations of\\nLoReFT.)\\nTraining objective. We consider both generation tasks using decoder-only or encoder–decoder\\nLMs and classification tasks using encoder-only models. The pretrained language model induces a\\ndistribution over token sequences p(⋅). We denote the model that results from the ReFT intervention\\nΦonp(⋅)aspΦ(⋅)with trainable parameters ϕ. To simplify notation, we refer to the hidden\\nrepresentations produced by the LM on input xash(x), and those by the intervened LM as hΦ(x).\\nFor generation tasks, our training objective is language modelling. Given an input sequence x=\\n(x1, . . . , x n)withntokens as the prompt, the goal is to predict the output sequence y=(y1, . . . , y m)\\n4LoRA is not applicable to the residual stream, which is weightless. LoRA can be configured to apply only\\nto the attention layer output projection matrix, which is similar to our residual stream intervention. However,\\nprevious works found that applying LoRA only to attention layers is sub-optimal [Hu et al., 2023].\\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='withmtokens.

We first define a general notion of intervention , i.e. the\\nmodification of hidden representations during the model forward pass:\\nDefinition 3.1. Anintervention Iis a tuple ⟨Φ, P, l⟩that encapsulates a single inference-time\\nmodification of the representations computed by a Transformer-based LM. The three components of\\nan intervention are (1) the intervention function Φ∶Rd→Rdwith learned parameters ϕ, (2) a set\\nofinput positions P⊆{1, . . . , n}that the intervention is applied to, and (3) the layer l∈{1, . . . , m}\\nat which the intervention is applied.\\nWe implement the intervention Ias the following operation that overwrites some representations h:\\nh(l)←(Φ(h(l)\\np)ifp∈Pelseh(l)\\np)p∈1,...,n(7)\\nThe intervention is applied immediately after the computation of h(l)and thus affects the representa-\\ntions computed in later layers h(l+1), . . . ,h(m).\\nFigure 2 provides a schematic overview of an intervention. A ReFT is then defined as a constrained\\nset of non-overlapping interventions:\\nDefinition 3.2. AReFT method is a set of finterventions I={I1, . . . , I f}. We enforce that for\\nany two interventions Ij, Ik∈Isuch that they operate on the same layer lj=lk, their intervention\\npositions must be disjoint, i.e. Pj∩Pk=∅. The parameters (ϕ1, . . . , ϕ f)of all of the intervention\\nfunctions are independent.\\nReFT is thus a generic framework encompassing interventions on hidden representations during the\\nmodel forward pass. In appendix B, we show how a variety of existing inference-time intervention\\nmethods can be described within this framework.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate our ReFTs against existing PEFTs, we conduct experiments across four diverse NLP\\nbenchmarks covering more than 20 datasets (extensive details on our datasets are in appendix C).\\nOur goal is to provide a rich picture of how LoReFT and DiReFT perform in different scenarios. We\\nexperiment with both masked and autoregressive LMs at different scales, ranging from RoBERTa-\\nbase [Liu et al., 2019] with 125M to LLaMA models [Touvron et al., 2023a,b] with 13B parameters.\\nWe benchmark against existing PEFTs such as prefix-tuning [Li and Liang, 2021], adapter-tuning\\nwith both Series Adapters and Parallel Adapters, BitFit [Ben Zaken et al., 2022], RED [Wu et al.,\\n2024a], LoRA [Hu et al., 2022], and DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. Our comparisons focus on both\\nperformance and parameter efficiency. In our comparisons, we use hyperparameter-tuned scores from\\nprevious works when possible. We load our base LMs in torch.bfloat16 to save memory. All of\\nour experiments are run with a single GPU: NVIDIA A100 40G/80G or RTX 6000 . Examples of\\nraw model generations are in appendix I.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='4.1 Hyperparameter configuration\\nFor our experiments, we must decide how many interventions to learn and which layers and input\\npositions to apply each one on. We propose learning interventions on a fixed number of pprefix and\\nssuffix positions in the prompt. Specifically, we tune four hyperparameters:\\n1. The number of prefix positions pto intervene on, i.e. positions {1, . . . , p}.\\n2. The number of suffix positions sto intervene on, i.e. positions {n−s+1, . . . , n}.\\n3. Which set of layers Lto intervene on.\\n4. Whether or not to tie intervention parameters ϕacross different positions in the same layer.\\nThis simplifies the hyperparameter search space; compared to LoRA, the only additional consideration\\nis which positions to intervene on. Since the number of positions edited is constant, LoReFT and\\nDiReFT contribute a fixed additional inference cost that does not scale with prompt length.\\nGiven the positions P={1, . . . , p}∪{n−s+1, . . . , n}, we define the untied and tied variants:\\nIuntied={⟨Φ,{p}, l⟩ ∣p∈P, l∈L} Itied={⟨Φ, P, l⟩ ∣l∈L}\\nAdditionally, when applying LoReFT and DiReFT to a prompt with length nwhere n<p+s, we\\nsetp←min(p,⌊n/2⌋)ands←min(s,⌈n/2⌉)and do not apply the truncated interventions in Iuntied.\\nWe also tune neural-network training hyperparameters.\\nUnlike previous work [Hu et al., 2022, 2023, Liu et al., 2024c] where hyperparameter tuning\\nmay involve optimising performance directly on test sets, we only tune our hyperparameters on\\ndevelopment sets which do not contain any overlapping examples with the test sets of our tasks.

[2023] and finetune LLaMA-1 7B/13B,\\nLlama-2 7B, and Llama-3 8B5on a combined dataset of eight commonsense reasoning tasks\\n(COMMONSENSE 170K ). We report scores on each task’s test set individually. We compare with\\nPEFTs benchmarked in Hu et al. [2023] as well as the identical experiment reported in Liu et al.\\n[2024c] for DoRA.\\nDatasets. Our benchmark contains eight commonsense reasoning datasets, including BoolQ [Clark\\net al., 2019], PIQA [Bisk et al., 2020], SIQA [Sap et al., 2019], HellaSwag [Zellers et al., 2019],\\nWinoGrande [Sakaguchi et al., 2021], ARC-e, ARC-c [Clark et al., 2018], and OBQA [Mihaylov\\net al., 2018]. Examples are formulated as multiple-choice problems where the model needs to directly\\ngenerate the correct choice without rationales. We use the same prompt template as in Hu et al.\\n[2023] with additional string normalisation (removing leading and trailing whitespace).\\nHyperparameter tuning. We do not do hyperparameter selection based on test set results. Rather,\\nwe use the hyperparameter settings of the model that performs best on a development set created\\nfrom the GSM8K training set, except we use a lower number of epochs (6 instead of 12) because\\ntheCOMMONSENSE 170K training set is more than 20 times larger than GSM8K . This allows us to\\ntune relevant hyperparamters, and also serves to test the robustness of these settings across different\\ndomains. We additionally report scores on 3 epochs in appendix D.3.\\nResults. We report results in table 1. LoReFT sets state-of-the-art performance on the commonsense\\nreasoning tasks, outperforming all other methods by a considerable margin. While being more\\ncompute-efficient, DiReFT achieves only slightly worse performance consistently.\\n4.3 Arithmetic reasoning\\nSimilar to the previous experiment, we follow the experimental setup in Hu et al.

We use\\nthis set of experiments to show LoReFT works well even with small-scale LMs, and can improve\\nrepresentations for classification tasks and not just text generation. We finetune RoBERTa-base\\n(125M) as well as RoBERTa-large (350M) on GLUE, a sequence classification benchmark for natural\\nlanguage understanding (NLU) which covers domains such as sentiment classification and natural\\nlanguage inference. Details about the GLUE benchmark can be found in its original paper. We\\nfollow Wu et al. [2024a] for proper evaluation on GLUE validation set: we split the validation set into\\ntwo sets guarded by a random seed, and we pick the best model with highest in-training validation\\naccuracy to evaluate on the other held-out half for testing accuracy.\\nHyperparameter tuning. We tune our hyperparameters for each task separately. which is standard\\nfor PEFTs. To avoid overfitting to random seeds, we hyperparameter-tune our models with a\\nconstant seed, and report averaged results over that and four additional unseen seeds. We describe\\nhyperparameter tuning experiments in Appendix D.1.\\nResults. We report results in table 4. LoReFT obtains comparable performance with PEFT methods\\non both model sizes when parameter matched with RED, the previous most parameter-efficient PEFT\\nfor this task. Furthermore, DiReFT achieves worse performance than most of the PEFTs suggesting\\nLoReFT is a better choice when LM is small. Full results with standard deviation is in table 13. We\\nadditionally compare against VeRA [Kopiczko et al., 2024] in appendix D.3.\\n5 Limitations\\nDue to limited resources, we mainly explored the LLaMA-family of models. In future work, we hope\\nto explore the effectiveness of ReFT on other model families as well as vision–language models such\\nas LLaV A [Liu et al., 2024a]. The capabilities of ReFT have not yet been fully explored due to the\\nlarge hyperparameter search space; we are interested in automating this search. We provide some\\ninitial explorations of LM personalisation with ReFT in a few-shot setting in appendix G.2. We hope\\nto explore why ReFT works, and we provide some of our early explorations focused on memorisation\\n(appendix F.1, appendix F.2). We are also investigating whether learned orthogonal subspaces can be\\ncomposed together without adaptation. Some encouraging initial findings are in appendix G.1.\\nReFT, abstraction, and generation. Neural network interpretability research often struggles to\\ncontribute directly to improving models. With ReFT, we have shown one way to overcome this'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='ReFT, abstraction, and generation. Neural network interpretability research often struggles to\\ncontribute directly to improving models. With ReFT, we have shown one way to overcome this\\nchallenge. The ReFT framework is rooted in work on causal abstraction [Geiger et al., 2023a] for\\nmodel interpretability, and LoReFT builds directly on the distributed interchange intervention method\\n9'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='of Geiger et al. [2023b] and Wu et al. [2023]. See also the interchange intervention training (IIT)\\nmethod of Geiger et al. [2022], Wu et al. [2022], Huang et al. [2023c]. In a similar vein, recent work\\nalso uses representation-based editing of the Transformer stream to steer model behavior [Li et al.,\\n2024, Zou et al., 2023]. ReFT advances this line of work by showing one way that such steering can\\nbe learned, rather than being merely a post hoc analysis step.\\nThe precise ways in which ReFT works deserve deeper exploration. Although these methods intervene\\non representations, the causal effect of such interventions may only emerge in the model’s upstream\\ncomputations. In other words, the power of ReFT may come from the fact that it creates new causal\\npathways or modifies the strength of some existing ones. We leave it to future research to track these\\neffects, and perhaps to explore more structured ReFTs to modify complex causal pathways in LMs.\\nReFT and model interpretability. ReFT relies on insights from work on interpretability, and it may\\nalso be able to contribute insights back to that field. In particular, LoReFT shows that training a set\\nof low-rank interventions on selected residual streams can induce a base LM to follow instructions\\n(section 4.4). In other words, a linear subspace distributed across a set of neurons can achieve\\ngeneralised control over a vast number of tasks. This is a serious challenge to work seeing to interpret\\nindividual neurons in isolation (for related criticisms, see Huang et al. 2023b). The success of ReFT\\nsuggests to us a quite different approach to interperetability, one that starts from the assumption that\\nneurons will play different roles in different contexts.\\nEvaluation practices in PEFT research. In this work, we hyperparameter-tune ReFT on develop-\\nment sets that do not overlap with the test set. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of the literature\\non PEFTs directly hill-climbs performance on test sets. This results in overfitting to specific tasks,\\nwhich gives practitioners less certainty about the real-world performance of different methods and\\nimpedes fair comparison. We hope that future work can introduce benchmarks for evaluating PEFTs\\nand ReFTs. These should allow for compute- or time-matched hyperparameter-tuning comparisons,\\nand they should disallow any kind of tuning or model selection based on the test set.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe propose a strong alternative to PEFTs, LoReFT, and we identify an ablation of this method,\\nDiReFT, that trades some performance for increased efficiency. Overall, LoReFT achieves strong per-\\nformance across benchmarks from four domains while being 15 ×–65×more efficient than LoRA. No-\\ntably, LoReFT establishes new state-of-the-art performance on commonsense reasoning, instruction-\\nfollowing, and natural language understanding against the strongest PEFTs. We also show how our\\nmethod can be described under a generic framework – ReFT. ReFT is a new approach to finetuning\\nthat is more powerful, more parameter-efficient, and more interpretable than any existing PEFTs.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Jing Huang for helpful discussion in designing our memorisation tests as well as writing.\\nWe thank Chenglei Si, Harshit Joshi, Jordan Juravsky, Julie Kallini, Ken Liu, Rohan Pandey, Jiuding\\nSun, Leonard Tang, Tristan Thrush, Shengguang Wu, Qinan Yu, Yanzhe Zhang, Amir Zur, and Shiqi\\nChen for helpful discussion about the project and comments on the manuscript.\\nReferences\\nAfra Amini, Tiago Pimentel, Clara Meister, and Ryan Cotterell.

Our library is built on top of pyvene [Wu et al., 2024b], a library for performing\\nand training activation interventions on arbitrary PyTorch models. Any pretrained LM available\\non HuggingFace is supported through our library for finetuning with ReFT methods, and finetuned\\nmodels can be easily uploaded to HuggingFace. The following example shows steps to wrap a\\nLlama-2 7B model with a single intervention on the residual stream output of the 19-th layer:\\nimport torch\\nimport transformers\\nfrom pyreft import get_reft_model , ReftConfig , LoreftIntervention , ReftTrainerForCausalLM\\n# loading huggingface model\\nmodel_name_or_path = \" yahma /llama -7b-hf\"\\nmodel = transformers .

We also provide data loading helpers to\\nconstruct training data that is compatible with HuggingFace trainers:\\ntokenizer = transformers . AutoTokenizer . from_pretrained ( model_name_or_path )\\n# get training data with customised dataloaders\\ndata_module = make_supervised_data_module (\\ntokenizer = tokenizer , model =model , layers =[19] ,\\ntraining_args = training_args , data_args = data_args )\\n# train\\ntrainer = reft .

Given that previous works have unified PEFTs\\nunder a single framework [He et al., 2022a], one may ask why not express ReFT as a PEFT\\nmethod? The main reason is that PEFT frameworks lack the notion of time orsequence (see the\\nunified PEFT view provided in Table 1 on pg. 5 of He et al., 2022a). In PEFTs, representation\\nmodifications are necessarily applied to every token in the sequence, even in recent variants such as\\nAdaLoRA [Zhang et al., 2023]. A key aspect of ReFT is that it leverages representations over time\\nand intervenes only on a small number of them while being effective. More importantly, the notation\\nof time is important for future versions of ReFT that intervene on representations schematically\\n(e.g. intervene on the first token at some early layers and then intervene on the last token at some later\\nlayers). The ability to intervene at different layer and position combinations schematically is also\\nsupported in our code. Existing PEFT libraries7enforce weight-based updates without supporting\\nflexible representation-based interventions.\\nB.1 RED\\nRED [Wu et al., 2024a] is a simple representation-editing method that applies an element-wise scaling\\ntransform s∈Rnand adds a bias b∈Rnto the hidden representation in every layer. The same\\nintervention is applied to every position (including at generated tokens, increasing inference burden)\\n7Seehttps://github.com/huggingface/peft .\\n20'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='but separate interventions are learned at each layer. In the ReFT framework, RED is defined as\\nΦRED(h)=s×h+b (8)\\nIRED={⟨ΦRED,{1, . . . , n}, l⟩ ∣l∈{1, . . . , m}} (9)\\nThe parameters ϕRED={s,b}are learned with gradient descent to minimise a loss function such as\\nlanguage-modelling loss or a classification loss, as in our experiments with LoReFT. We believe that\\nRED is better classified as a kind of adapter due to its application at all positions.\\nB.2 Activation addition\\nActivation addition [Turner et al., 2023] takes the difference in activations at at some positions pand\\nqand layer lgiven two contrastive prompts x+andx−as input. It then adds this difference vector,\\nscaled by a tuned constant c, to representations at all positions in layer lfor some new prompt.\\na=h(x+)(l)\\np−h(x−)(l)\\nq (10)\\nΦActAdd(h)=h+c⋅a (11)\\nIActAdd={⟨ϕActAdd ,{1, . . . , n}, l⟩} (12)\\nB.3 RepE\\nZou et al. [2023] introduce several intervention methods for controlling model behaviour, which they\\nterm representation engineering .\\nFirst, given a set of prompts {x1, . . . ,xn}designed to elicit the presence of a concept, we randomly\\npair them, take the difference in activations for each pair, and find the first principle component of the\\ndifference vectors at the last token position in some layer of interest lto obtain a reading vector :\\nareading=PCA({h(xi)(l)\\n−1−h(xi+1)(l)\\n−1∣i≡0 mod 2 })\\n1(13)\\nOne can also used a more structured pairing of constrastive prompts to obtain a contrast vector ,\\nsimilar to the difference vector computed in activation addition:\\nacontrast=PCA({h(x+\\ni)(l)\\n−1−h(x−\\ni)(l)\\n−1∣1≤i≤n})\\n1(14)\\nThen, using either areading oracontrast , RepE introduces three operators (i.e. parametrisations of Φ)\\nfor intervening on activations:\\nΦRepE,linear(h)=h±c⋅a (15)\\nΦRepE,piecewise(h)=h+c⋅sign(a⋅h)⋅a (16)\\nΦRepE,projection(h)=h−c⋅a⋅h\\n∥a∥2⋅a (17)\\nThe first two of these are similar to activation addition, while the latter is a scaled one-dimensional\\ndistributed interchange intervention that is a special case of LoReFT. These operations are then used\\nto intervene on some set of positions P⊆{1, . . . , n}in the layer of interest:\\nIRepE={⟨ΦRepE, P, l⟩} (18)\\nRepE introduces another model control method called Low-Rank Representation Adaptation\\n(LoRRA), which is a kind of PEFT rather than a ReFT since it tunes model weights using a variant of\\nLoRA.\\nC Datasets\\nC.1 Commonsense reasoning\\nWe train and evaluate our models on eight datasets covering different domains of open-ended QA\\ntasks:\\n1.TheBoolQ [Clark et al., 2019] dataset, which is a question-answering dataset for yes or\\nno naturally occurring questions.

They are included in the MAWPS training dataset, and thus leaked into the\\ntraining dataset.\\nC.3 Natural language understanding\\nWe follow Wu et al. [2024a] for proper evaluation on the GLUE validation set. We split the validation\\nset into two subsets, using one subset guarded by a random seed for in-training evaluation and the\\nother for testing. Specifically, after each training epoch, we evaluate the model on our in-training\\n22'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='evaluation set and select the best model across all epochs for testing. For datasets with a large\\nvalidation set (i.e., QQP, MNLI, and QNLI), we select 1,000 samples for in-training evaluation. For\\nthe remaining smaller datasets, we select half of the samples for this purpose. For the evaluation\\nmetric, we use the Matthews correlation coefficient for CoLA, the Pearson correlation coefficient for\\nSTS-B, and accuracy for the other datasets. For MNLI, we report results only on the matched version.\\nD Hyperparameters\\nD.1 Hyperparameter tuning and decoding strategy\\nCommonsense reasoning and arithmeric reasoning. We create a standalone development set by\\ntaking the last 300 examples from the GSM8K training set. We train our models with the remaining\\ntraining set of GSM8K and select the hyperparameter settings based on model performance on the\\ndevelopment set. We select the hyperparameters using LLaMA-7B, and apply the same settings to\\nLLaMA-13B without additional tuning. We use a maximum sequence length of 512 for training and\\nhyperparameter tuning, and a maximum new token number of 32 for inference. Table 5 and table 6\\ndescribes our hyperparameter search space. We use a lower number of epochs (6 instead of 12) for\\nthe commonsense reasoning benchmark because the COMMONSENSE 170K training set is more than\\n20 times larger than GSM8K.\\nDuring inference, we use greedy decoding without sampling for the commonsense reasoning bench-\\nmark, since it is a multi-token classification benchmark, and use the same decoding strategy as in\\nHu et al. [2023] for the arithmetic reasoning benchmark with a higher temperature 0.3. The reason\\nto switch to a slightly different set of decoding hyperparameters is that the HuggingFace decoding\\nfunction may throw an error due to statistical instability with close-to-zero probabilities over output\\ntokens with beam search.8\\nInstruction following. We finetune LLaMA-7B on Alpaca-52K [Taori et al., 2023] to select hy-\\nperparameters. We select the hyperparameter settings based on model performance evaluated with\\nAlpaca-Eval v1.0 [Li et al., 2023], which calculates the win-rate over text-davinci-003 by using\\ngpt-4-turbo as the annotator. We use a maximum sequence length of 768 for training and hyper-\\nparameter tuning, and a maximum new token number of 2048 for inference. Table 7 describes our\\nhyperparameter search space.\\nDuring inference, we use the same decoding strategy as in RED [Wu et al., 2024a] to ensure a fair\\ncomparison. Specifically, we use greedy decoding without sampling, and use a maximum repetition\\nn-gram size of 5 with a repetition penalty of 1.1.\\nNatural language understanding. We conduct hyperparameter tuning with RoBERTa-base and\\nRoBERTa-large for each task individually. We pick the hyperparameters based on testing performance\\non the held-out validation set with a fixed random seed of 42. We then evaluate our model with\\nadditional four unseen seeds {43, 44, 45, 46} for final results. We follow Wu et al. [2024a]’s setting\\nfor evaluation. For QQP with RoBERTa-large, there are some stochasticity in runs with the same\\nseed, so we picked the best run out of 3 runs for any particular seed. As reported by Wu et al. [2024a],\\nwe also observe that evaluation results on RTE are unstable due to the small size of the dataset. We\\nthus replace several random seeds as in Wu et al. [2024a] to ensure a fair comparison. In addition, we\\nreplace one or two random seeds for CoLA for stability. Table 8 describes our hyperparameter search\\nspace. Table 9 to table 12 describe our hyperparameter settings for each task.\\nWe conduct separate hyperparameter tuning for LoReFT and DiReFT to ensure a fair comparison.\\n8See reference ticket: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/11267 .\\n23'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='Table 5: Hyperparameter search space of LLaMA-1 7B models with LoReFT on the GSM8K\\ndevelopment set with the best settings underlined .

Here, we recom-\\nmand a non-exhaustive list for choosing the best hyperparameter settings for your tasks:\\n•Intervening on multiple positions delivers significant gains . We find that intervening only\\non a single token position (e.g., just the first one or the last one) is always less optimal than\\nintervening on multiple tokens. However, intervening on excessive number of tokens might\\nharm performance by slowing down convergence.\\n•Intervening on all layers first, and then shrink down . Intervening on all layers often\\nprovides a good baseline. We recommand users to start with all layers, and shrink down\\nthe number of intervening layers depending on the desired performance–parameter count\\nbalance.\\n•Higher rank may not entail better performance . High rank entails higher parameter\\ncount, but it does not always bring performance gain (likely due to slower convergence). We\\nrecommend users to start with a rank that is lower than 32 (e.g. rank 4).\\n•Tie intervention weights as much as you can . In the paper, we explore tying the interven-\\ntion weights between prefix and suffix token positions. It automatically halves the parameter\\ncount, and it can result in better performance as well. We suspect weight sharing across\\nlayers may also help.\\n•Hyperparameter tuning with learning rate, warmup ratio, dropout rate and weight\\ndecay should go after other hyperparameters . These classic neural-network training\\nhyperparameters can play a role, yet they have much smaller effect than previous ones.\\nD.3 Additional hyperparameter-tuning results of LoReFT\\nAs a result of our hyperparameter searching process, LoReFT is trained with more epochs compared to\\nLoRA [Hu et al., 2022] or DoRA [Liu et al., 2024c]. This raises the concern whether our performance\\ngain is purely due to the larger number of epochs. We thus rerun our experiments with the exact same\\nnumber of epochs and effective batch size as LoRA or DoRA. Results are shown in table 14 and\\ntable 15. With matched hyperparameters, LoReFT shows similar results by outperforming previous\\nmethods significantly on eight commonsense reasoning datasets.\\nRecently, VeRA was proposed as a new variant of LoRA that further reduces the number of trainable\\nparameters while maintaining performance [Kopiczko et al., 2024]. Table 16 shows our results\\ncompared against VeRA as well as the baseline numbers reported in VeRA’s paper. We include this\\nset of results in the appendix, given that the hyperparameter tuning process is drastically different\\nfrom ours.9The original VeRA implementation records the performance of the best epoch on the\\nvalidation set, which could cause overfitting since results are selected based on test set performance.\\n9VeRA’s original implementation can be found at https://openreview.net/notes/edits/attachment?\\nid=D0dcbrnPq0&name=supplementary_material .\\n29'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='Table 14: Accuracy comparison of LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B against existing PEFT methods on\\neight commonsense reasoning datasets.∗Performance results of all baseline methods are taken from\\nLiu et al.

We focus\\non the arithmetic reasoning benchmark since it is the most difficult for LoReFT and trains relatively\\nquickly. We conduct experiments with the following parametrisations:\\n1.Φ(h)=h+W⊺\\n2(W1h+b−W2h)where both W1,W2∈Rr×dare low-rank Non-\\northogonal linear projection matrices. It has the same trainable parameter count as LoReFT\\nyet with lower memory overhead by removing the orthonormal constraint.\\n2.Φ(h)=h+R⊺(Wh+b)which directly edits the representation in a learned linear\\nsubspace.

Similar tests have\\nalso been studied in terms of activation-based adversarial attacks in the original basis [Fort, 2023].\\nSpecifically, we learn a single rank-1 LoReFT at a single layer on the residual stream of the last\\nprompt token to recover a specific output sequence with length Lm. For simplicity, we simplify\\nLoReFT in Eqn. 2 by removing Wh to make the intervention input-independent, where we learn\\na single scalar bbesides the low-rank matrix. As a result, our simplified rank-1 LoReFT contains\\nprecisely 4,097 parameters for LLaMA-1 7B and 5,121 parameters for LLaMA-1 13B models.10\\nWe measure the memory power by how large Lmcan be, and how accurate the recovered output\\nsequence is with prefix length exact match in percentage. We use the first few thousand words of\\nthe book Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland [Carroll, 1865] as our recovery sequence. Our prompt\\nis constructed as ALIC#ID1-> followed by model generations. We train with 1000 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 4×10−3and a linear learning rate scheduler without warm-up.\\nAs shown in fig. 3 and fig. 4, both models can successfully remember up to 2,048 tokens across\\nmost layers with a 100% recovery rate. As a result, a rank-1 intervention can thus correctly recover\\na sequence of at least 2,048 in length. LLaMA-1 7B starts to fail catastrophically after the length\\nexceeds 2,048, suggesting that positional embeddings might play a role, or the maximum sequence\\nlength during pretraining. LLaMA-1 13B shows better memorisation for lengths up to 2,560,\\nsuggesting memorisation scales with model size. Note that we may heavily underestimate the model’s\\npower of memorisation due to the fact that our hyperparameters are picked with an educated guess\\nwithout tuning.\\nFrom fig. 5 to fig. 8, we conduct harder tests by asking our models to recover a scrambled version\\n(word order is scrambled) of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and to recover a random token\\nsequence. Recovery rates for these two conditions are significantly worse than the original book,\\nsuggesting that pretraining data memorisation may play a role in terms of recovery rate, given that\\nthe book is highly likely in the pretraining corpus. Moreover, both models can only recover random\\ntoken sequences up to 128 tokens, suggesting that word morphology also plays a role. Our results\\nalso suggest that a single rank-1 intervention can transmit over 128 bits of token identity sequence\\nusing the hyperparameters we have.11\\n10These parameters take about 17.5KB of disk space.\\n11Our code is at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/pyreft/tree/main/examples/memorisation .\\n33'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='Figure 3: Memorisation test results for LLaMA-1 7B model on recovering first n-th tokens of the\\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland by rank-1 LoReFT intervention on various layers of the last token’s\\nresidual stream.

Our results suggest that a rank-1 intervention can reliably remember\\nup to 256 pairs, with near-perfect recall in layer 20 of the 13B model. Recalling the fact that our\\nsimplified LoReFT intervention learns only a single scalar b, which is input-dependent, means the\\nlearned scalar, when projected back into the original basis, allows the distributed representation of\\nthe scalar to enable the model to correctly generate the output token. As a result, it is evidence that\\ntoken identities are likely superpositioned in the original basis, and linear decomposition (i.e., our\\nlearned projection matrix R) can disentangle superpositioned information to some degree.\\n35'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='G Capabilities experiments\\nG.1 Multi-task learning: Learned ReFTs are like puzzle pieces\\nVarious works have studied how to merge model weights, or PEFT weights together to achieve multi-\\ntask learning (MTL) without adaptation [Li et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2023a, Zhang et al., 2024a,\\nZhong et al., 2024].

We know that x = 60/2 = 30\\nmiles/hour.\\nThe time it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles is:\\ntime = distance / speed\\ntime = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour\\ntime = 8 hours\\nNow we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it took the\\ncar in the slow lane to travel the same distance:\\ntime = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour\\ntime = 16 hours\\nTherefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as\\nthe car in the fast lane.\\n43'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data/reft-paper.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='Instruction (Alpaca-Eval)\\nList the layers of the TCP/IP model and for each layer identify one protocol.\\nResponse\\nModel Response\\nLlama-2 7B (LoReFT) The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is a\\nstandard network communication model used to transmit data across the internet.\\nIt consists of four main layers, each with its own set of protocols:\\n1.

Some examples of protocols at this layer include HTTP\\n(Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple\\nMail Transfer Protocol), and Telnet.\\n2. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures reliable delivery of data between\\napplications on different machines. Examples of protocols at the transport\\nlayer include TCP (Transmission ControlProtocol) and UDP (User Datagram\\nProtocol).\\n3. Network Layer: The network layer handles routing and forwarding of packets\\nacross multiple networks. Examples of network-layer protocols include IP\\n(Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).\\n4. Link Layer: The link layer deals with the physical connection between\\ndevices on the same network segment. Examples of link-layer protocols are\\nEthernet, Token Ring, and FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface).\\nIn summary, the TCP/IP Model has four layers: application, transport, network,\\nand link.

It also handles\\nmultiplexing and de-multiplexing of data streams. Examples include TCP\\n(Transmission Control protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).\\n3. **Internet Layer** - Also known as the Network Layer, this layer routes\\npackets from source to destination based on IP addresses. It includes protocols\\nlike IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6).\\n4. **Data Link Layer** - Responsible for transmitting data over physical links\\nsuch as Ethernet or WiFi. It uses protocols like ARP (Address Resolution\\nProtocol) and SLIP (Serial Line Interface Protocol).\\nPlease note that some protocols may be implemented at more than one layer in\\nthe TCP/IP stack.
