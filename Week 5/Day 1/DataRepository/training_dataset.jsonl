The risk of such biased results and discriminatory effects is particularly relevant with regard to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities.

In particular, natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services from public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social services providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age and loss of employment and social and housing assistance, are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a\u00a0vulnerable position in relation to the responsible", "74aeb489-8b78-48d7-a0e6-3d2787cd66f8": "to the responsible authorities.

AI systems used for those purposes may lead to discrimination between persons or groups and may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, such as that based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age or sexual orientation, or may create new forms of discriminatory impacts.

In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a\u00a0discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner.
